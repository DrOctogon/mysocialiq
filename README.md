Taking control of user data to help educate and protect society. 

---
Create the First Scoring Measure of a Persons Online Use.
• Create an Algorithm that will both Mine Data Points from a Persons Online

Accounts such as: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Google,
GoFundMe, TicTok, Snapchat, WhatsApp, Email Scan, etc. and Compile into
a Simplified Scoring Range.

• The Scoring will Range between 0 -500. 500 Being the Highest Score one

can Achieve.

• MySocialIQ will be Supported by Multiple Applications:

1. iPhone
2. Android
3. Desktops, Laptops, ipads, etc.

• mySocialIQ will Act Similar to how a Credit Score Works. Negative Items,
Missed Payments, Bankruptcies have Negative Impacts and Paying off Debt
and Paying Responsibility Adds Positive Points.

• mySocialIQ will Score a Persons: Search History, Social Media Postings,
Comments, Arguments, Positive Posts, Negative Posts, Trolling, Community
Work, Donations, Basic Criminal Activity, etc.

Similar to a Credit Score, mySocialIQ Scores will Fluctuate Every Time it

Gets Updated by a User.

• mySocialIQ Users will Be Able to Dispute Items and/or Posting That They

Believe are Not Theirs.

• mySocialIQ will Utilize Complex Algorithms' To Both Mine and Analyze a

Users Social Media History.

• mySocialIQ Users will be Required to Provide mySocialIQ With Necessary

Release to Mine Their Data. All Data will be Encrypted to Protect all
Confidential Information.

• mySocialIQ is Created out of the Necessity to Help Keep Users on Social
Media Accountable for What They “Publicize”. Too Many People Hide Behind
Their Computers/Phones and Post the Most Vial Attacks on Complete
Strangers With Impunity. mySocialIQ will Strive to Hold People Accountable.
This is Not Censorship, it is Accountability.
